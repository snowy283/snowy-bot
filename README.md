# Description #
This is a bot that I plan to make an auto-host rotate bot in the near future.
At the moment (24/07/24) it only has one command but I am planning on fixing that.

# Commands (to be updated) #
_Note: The prefix used is "."_
.hello : says "Hello" and asks how your day is.

# Future Commands # 
.rotate : makes an auto host rotate
.rps <argument> : does rock paper scissors, for example:
RandomGuyUsingSnowyBot: .rps paper
(this will be random) SnowyBot: I choose scissors. I win!/paper. We drew! Wanna play again? :D/rock. Aw man, you won. Let's do a rematch!
